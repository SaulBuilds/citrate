# Sprint 1: Core GhostDAG Implementation - Complete ✓

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Project Structure ✓
- Created fresh workspace with modular architecture
- Set up `core/consensus` module with proper dependencies
- Configured workspace-wide dependency management

### 2. GhostDAG Core Types ✓
**File**: `core/consensus/src/types.rs`
- `Block` structure with selected_parent and merge_parents
- `BlueSet` for tracking blue blocks
- `GhostDagParams` with k-cluster configuration
- `Hash`, `PublicKey`, `Signature` primitives
- Proper serialization support

### 3. Blue Set Algorithm ✓
**File**: `core/consensus/src/ghostdag.rs`
- Complete blue set calculation following k-cluster rule
- Blue score computation
- Anticone size checking
- Ancestry verification (is_ancestor_of)
- Caching for performance

### 4. DAG Storage ✓
**File**: `core/consensus/src/dag_store.rs`
- Block storage and retrieval
- Parent-child relationship tracking
- Tips management
- Finalization support
- Pruning capability
- Height-based indexing

### 5. Testing ✓
- 11 unit tests all passing
- Coverage includes:
  - Blue set calculation
  - DAG storage operations
  - Tips management
  - Finalization
  - Pruning

## Key Implementation Decisions

1. **Selected Parent + Merge Parents**: Correctly implemented the GhostDAG structure where each block has one selected parent and multiple merge parents

2. **Blue/Red Distinction**: Implemented proper blue set calculation with k-cluster rule (k=18 by default)

3. **Efficient Caching**: Added blue set caching to avoid recalculation

4. **Test Fix**: Resolved genesis block hash collision with Hash::default() by using non-zero hashes in tests

## Code Quality

- Clean separation of concerns
- Comprehensive error handling with thiserror
- Async/await throughout for scalability
- Proper use of Arc<RwLock<>> for thread-safe sharing
- Tracing integration for observability

## Next Steps (Sprint 2)

1. **Tip Selection Algorithm**: Implement sophisticated tip selection based on blue scores
2. **VRF Proposer Selection**: Add verifiable random function for leader election
3. **Parent Selection Logic**: Implement logic for choosing selected vs merge parents
4. **Integration Tests**: Add cross-module integration testing
