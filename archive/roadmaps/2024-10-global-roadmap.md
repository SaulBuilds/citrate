}
```

#### SPRINT 4.3.3: Rating & Review System (Day 5)

**Files:** `mobile/lattice-marketplace/`

**Framework:** React Native + Web3 Mobile
**Deliverables:**
- Mobile-optimized model browsing
- QR code-based payments
- Push notifications for model updates
- Offline model metadata caching

### Remaining Phase 4 (Weeks 5-8)

#### Weeks 5-6: Governance & Economics
- LATTICE governance token (ERC-20 + governance extensions)
- DAO governance system with proposal and voting
- Dynamic pricing algorithms
- Multi-party revenue sharing protocols

#### Weeks 7-8: Production Deployment & Launch

## Outstanding Critical Issues (Blocking Production)

### ðŸš¨ High Priority Transaction Pipeline Issues

#### ISSUE-1: EIP-1559 Transaction Decoder
**File:** `core/api/src/eth_tx_decoder.rs`
**Problem:** Limited support for typed transactions blocks modern wallet compatibility
**Impact:** MetaMask and other modern wallets cannot interact with Citrate
**Implementation:** Full EIP-1559 decoder with legacy transaction fallback

#### ISSUE-2: Address Derivation Mismatches
**File:** `core/execution/src/executor.rs:338`
**Problem:** 20-byte EVM addresses embedded in 32-byte fields cause transfer failures
**Impact:** Token transfers fail, balance queries return incorrect results
**Implementation:** Standardized address conversion utilities

#### ISSUE-3: Pending Nonce Support
**File:** `core/api/src/eth_rpc.rs:389`
**Problem:** RPC uses "latest" instead of "pending" for nonce queries
**Impact:** Sequential transactions get blocked with "nonce too low" errors
**Implementation:** Proper mempool-aware nonce calculation

#### ISSUE-4: Mempool Visibility
**Files:** `core/api/src/`, `core/sequencer/src/mempool.rs`
**Problem:** No transaction status endpoint for debugging
**Impact:** Cannot troubleshoot stuck or failed transactions
**Implementation:** `/mempool` REST endpoint with transaction lifecycle tracking

## Quality Standards & Implementation Guidelines

### ðŸŽ¯ No Mocks, Stubs, or Incomplete Implementations
All code delivered must be:
- **Fully functional** - No placeholder or mock implementations
- **Production-ready** - Proper error handling, logging, and edge cases
- **Well-tested** - Unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end scenarios
- **Documented** - Clear API documentation and usage examples
- **Secure** - Security best practices, input validation, and access controls

### Code Quality Requirements
- **Test Coverage:** Minimum 90% for all new components
- **Security:** All smart contracts must pass formal verification
- **Performance:** Sub-100ms response times for API endpoints
- **Documentation:** Every public API must have examples and documentation

### Implementation Priorities
1. **Critical Bug Fixes** - Transaction pipeline issues must be resolved first
2. **Core Functionality** - Complete working features before adding new ones
3. **User Experience** - Intuitive interfaces with proper error handling
4. **Security** - Security-first development with continuous auditing
5. **Performance** - Optimize for production-scale usage
