### Sprint 5 Focus
This sprint builds **advanced features and optimization** on top of Sprint 4's discovery foundation. We're implementing:
1. **Model Comparison Tool** - Side-by-side comparison with export capability
2. **Creator Analytics Dashboard** - Revenue tracking, usage patterns, demographics
3. **Batch Operations** - Multi-select, bulk updates, batch pricing
4. **Mobile Optimization** - Responsive grids, touch gestures, mobile navigation
5. **Performance Enhancement** - Virtual scrolling, lazy loading, optimization

## Risk Register

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Virtual scrolling complexity causes bugs | Medium | High | Thorough testing with various list sizes, use proven library (react-window) |
| Batch operations fail partially causing inconsistent state | Medium | High | Implement transaction rollback, show clear progress indicators, add undo |
| Mobile performance doesn't meet targets | Low | Medium | Prioritize optimization tasks, use Lighthouse CI, progressive enhancement |
| Comparison tool too complex for users | Low | Medium | User testing, simplify UI, provide tooltips and guidance |
| Service worker causes caching issues | Medium | Low | Cache versioning strategy, clear cache on updates, fallback to network |
| Analytics calculations are too slow | Low | Medium | Pre-compute aggregates, use background jobs, implement caching |

## Dependencies

### External Libraries Needed
- `react-window` or `react-virtualized` (virtualized scrolling)
- `use-gesture` or `react-use-gesture` (touch gestures)
- `jspdf` or `pdfmake` (PDF export for comparisons)
- `papaparse` (CSV export)
- `workbox` (service worker generation)
- `recharts` (already installed, for additional analytics charts)
- `react-beautiful-dnd` (drag-and-drop for comparison)

### Backend/Node Dependencies
- No new backend dependencies expected
- Optimization of existing RPC endpoints
- Database indexing improvements

### Smart Contract Additions (Optional)
- Consider `batchUpdateModels()` function for gas-efficient bulk updates
- Analytics event tracking (can remain off-chain)

### Blocked By
- Sprint 4 completion (discovery and quality metrics)
- Performance baseline measurements

### Blocking
- Sprint 6 (if planned) builds on these optimizations
- Mobile app development relies on mobile-optimized web UI
