# Distribution Strategy (v3, 2025-09-06)

## Narrative Alignment
- Reframe messaging around **GhostDAG performance** and **MCP‑native AI**.
- Educate on verifiable AI and ComputeMarket economics.

## Token Allocation (illustrative, subject to legal review)
Mirrors v2 proportions; vesting via audited vesting contracts; DAO treasury for MCP benchmarks and public datasets.

## Community Plan
- Bi‑weekly engineering updates; monthly AMAs; workshops on MCP and primitives.
- Grants for adapters (OpenAI/Anthropic client SDKs, LangChain/LlamaIndex connectors).
