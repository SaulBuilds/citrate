Lattice — 32‑Sprint Plan (v3, 2025-09-06)

• S1‑4  Core Network (GhostDAG): tip selection, mergeset, blue score; finality gadget α; DAG explorer basics.
• S5‑6  Sequencer & Mempool: tx classes, bundle policy for model updates; timestamping & logging spec.
• S7‑8  LVM & Precompiles: MCP helpers, LoRA apply/merge, artifact commits; gas schedule.
• S9‑10 Primitives v1: ModelRegistry, StorageRegistry.
• S11‑12 InferenceRouter v1: job escrow, provider registry, SLA receipts.
• S13‑14 LoRAFactory v1: mint/merge deltas, royalties.
• S15‑16 ComputeMarket α: staking, GPU supply; scheduler prototype.
• S17‑18 Trainer α: fine‑tune orchestration; checkpoint lineage.
• S19‑20 Eval/Attest α: standard benchmarks; PoT/PoE receipts.
• S21‑22 Bridge α: ZK light‑client proofs; custody‑free transfers.
• S23‑24 Enterprise: RBAC, data residency, private validators.
• S25‑26 Security Audit + PenTest; fuzzing; economic sims.
• S27‑29 Performance: sustained 10k TPS, <12s finality, global propagation <1s.
• S30‑31 Privacy: encrypted prompts, proofs‑of‑access.
• S32     Operations: SRE runbooks, DR/backup, on‑call.

Success Metrics & QA remain as v2 with MCP/AI additions (coverage >80%, bug escape <5%, 99.5% uptime testnet).

Deliverables by milestone: testnet α (S12), β (S22), mainnet (S32).
