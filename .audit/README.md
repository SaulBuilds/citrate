# Citrate Audit Workspace

This directory holds audit documentation for the Citrate project. It focuses on the GUI-embedded node and code-generation flow for smart contracts, while tracking cross-cutting blockchain risks.

## Contents
- `roadmap.md` — phased audit plan, checklists, and validation gates.
- `findings.md` — current findings, gaps, and recommendations.

## Conventions
- Keep entries concise, date-stamped, and include file/line references when possible.
- Note assumptions and reproduction steps for each finding.
- Do not commit binaries or generated artifacts here.
