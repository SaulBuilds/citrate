## Risk Register

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Dark mode CSS variables conflict with existing styles | Medium | Medium | Test incrementally, use scoped variables |
| Virtual scrolling breaks existing layouts | Low | High | Maintain same DOM structure, test thoroughly |
| Web Workers add complexity without benefits | Low | Low | Benchmark before and after, keep fallback |
| Keyboard shortcuts conflict with browser defaults | Medium | Low | Use Ctrl+Shift combinations, document clearly |
| State persistence causes data corruption | Low | High | Add version checking, validation on load |

## Dependencies

### External Libraries Needed
- `react-window` or `react-virtuoso` (virtual scrolling)
