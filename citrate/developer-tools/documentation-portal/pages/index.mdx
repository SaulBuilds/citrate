# Lattice AI Blockchain Developer Documentation

Welcome to the comprehensive developer documentation for Lattice AI Blockchain - the first AI-native Layer-1 blockchain designed specifically for artificial intelligence applications.

## What is Lattice?

Lattice is a revolutionary blockchain platform that makes AI models first-class citizens of the blockchain ecosystem. Built on a high-performance GhostDAG consensus mechanism, Lattice enables:

- **AI Model Deployment**: Deploy machine learning models directly to the blockchain
- **Decentralized Inference**: Run AI inference in a decentralized manner
- **Model Monetization**: Create marketplaces for AI models and services
- **Verifiable AI**: Ensure transparency and auditability of AI operations

## Quick Start

Get started with Lattice development in minutes:

```bash
# Install Lattice SDK
npm install lattice-js
# or
pip install lattice-sdk

# Connect to Lattice node
const client = new LatticeClient('http://localhost:8545')

# Deploy your first AI model
const result = await client.deployModel({
  modelData: modelBytes,
  metadata: { name: "My AI Model" },
  price: "1000000000000000000" // 1 ETH
})
```
