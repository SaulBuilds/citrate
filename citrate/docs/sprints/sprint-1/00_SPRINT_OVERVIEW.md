### Story 4: Loading Skeletons (3 points)
**As a** user
**I want to** see content placeholders while data loads
**So that** the app feels faster and I know what to expect

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Skeleton loaders for Dashboard (node status, block height)
- Skeleton loaders for Wallet (account list, balances)
- Skeleton loaders for DAG (block table)
- Skeleton loaders for Models (model list)
- Smooth transition from skeleton to actual content
- Skeletons match the shape of real content

**Files to Create:**
- `gui/citrate-core/src/components/skeletons/DashboardSkeleton.tsx`
- `gui/citrate-core/src/components/skeletons/WalletSkeleton.tsx`
- `gui/citrate-core/src/components/skeletons/TableSkeleton.tsx`
- `gui/citrate-core/src/components/skeletons/CardSkeleton.tsx`

**Files to Modify:**
- `gui/citrate-core/src/components/Dashboard.tsx`
- `gui/citrate-core/src/components/Wallet.tsx`
- `gui/citrate-core/src/components/DAGVisualization.tsx`
- `gui/citrate-core/src/components/Models.tsx`

## Definition of Done

A story is considered "Done" when:
- [ ] Code is written and follows TypeScript/React best practices
- [ ] All acceptance criteria are met
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Manual testing completed
- [ ] No console errors or warnings
- [ ] Code reviewed by another team member
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Merged to main branch

## Risk Register

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Password storage library incompatible with Tauri | Low | High | Research Tauri keyring support before implementation |
| Validation regex too strict, blocks valid inputs | Medium | Medium | Test with diverse input samples |
| Skeletons don't match content layout | Low | Low | Use same CSS classes as actual content |
| Breaking changes to wallet API | Low | High | Keep backward compatibility, test thoroughly |

---

## Dependencies

### External Libraries Needed
- `zxcvbn` (password strength estimation) - Already available in Rust
- `react-loading-skeleton` (optional, can build custom)
- Tauri `keyring` plugin (for secure password storage)

### Blocked By
- None (sprint can start immediately)

### Blocking
- Sprint 2 (IPFS) depends on input validation for file metadata
