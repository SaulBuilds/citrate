### Documentation Archived

#### Phase Progress & Completion Reports → `/archive/phase-history/`
- `PHASE1_PROGRESS.md`
- `PHASE1_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md`
- `PHASE3_PROGRESS.md`
- `PHASE3_COMPLETION.md`

**Already in archive**:
- PHASE1_COMPLETE.md
- PHASE1_VERIFICATION.md
- PHASE2_* (4 files)
- WEEK_1_2_* (2 files)

#### Test Reports & Audits → `/archive/testing/` & `/archive/audits/`
- `FINAL_TEST_REPORT.md` → `/archive/testing/`
- `TEST_SUITE_COMPLETION_REPORT.md` → `/archive/testing/`
- `TEST_AUDIT_REPORT.md` → `/archive/testing/`

**Note**: Original roadmaps kept temporarily as they contain active reference material. Can be removed after `ROADMAP_P0.md` is fully comprehensive.

#### Deployment Guides → `/archive/deployment-guides/`
- `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` (old, redundant) → `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE_old.md`
- `TESTNET_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` (merged into main DEPLOYMENT.md)

- `INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md` → `docs/guides/installation.md`
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` → `docs/guides/deployment.md`
- `GENESIS_STARTUP_GUIDE.md` → `docs/guides/genesis-startup.md`
- `WALLET_AND_REWARDS_GUIDE.md` → `docs/guides/wallet-and-rewards.md`

**Technical Documentation** → `docs/technical/`:
- `docs/GENESIS_MODEL.md` → `docs/technical/genesis-model.md`

**Current Roadmap** → `docs/`:
- `ROADMAP_P0.md` → `docs/roadmap-p0.md`

**Benefits**:
- 📁 Logical categorization by audience (operators vs technical)
- 🔍 Easy navigation with clear folder structure
- 📚 Centralized documentation location
- ✅ All references updated across governance documents

## 🎯 Next Steps & Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Optional)
1. **SDK Consolidation** (Manual Review Required)
   - Compare `citrate/sdk/javascript/` vs `citrate/sdks/javascript/lattice-js/`
   - Merge best features into `sdks/javascript/lattice-js/`
   - Update all references in code and docs
   - Test SDK functionality
   - Delete `sdk/` directory after verification

2. **Finalize Roadmap Consolidation** (After Review)
   - Review if `GLOBAL_ROADMAP.md` and `PHASE4_ROADMAP.md` can be fully replaced by `ROADMAP_P0.md`
   - If yes, delete originals (already archived)
   - If no, update `ROADMAP_P0.md` with missing details first

### Maintenance Protocol

#### Quarterly Documentation Audit (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4)
1. Review all root-level `.md` files
2. Identify candidates for archival
3. Verify DOCUMENTATION_MATRIX.md is current
4. Check for duplicate content
5. Update DOCUMENTATION.md if governance rules need clarification

#### Before Creating Any New Documentation
**Mandatory Checklist**:
1. ✅ Check DOCUMENTATION_MATRIX.md
2. ✅ Read DOCUMENTATION.md governance rules
3. ✅ Check /archive/ for historical context
4. ✅ Determine: CLAUDE.md, README, or docs-portal?
5. ✅ Plan: When will this be archived? Who maintains it?

#### When Information Becomes Historical
1. Move file to appropriate `/archive/` subdirectory
2. Rename with date: `YYYY-MM-original-name.md`
3. Update links in other docs
4. Add entry to `CHANGELOG.md`

## 📊 Impact Summary

### Documentation Organization
- **Before**: 50+ markdown files scattered across monorepo, many duplicates/outdated
- **After**: Clear single source of truth for each topic, historical docs archived with dates
- **Governance**: Explicit protocol preventing future sprawl

### Repository Cleanliness
- **Before**: 11GB+ of build artifacts, unclear file purposes
- **After**: Clean root with only essential files, clear organization
- **Space Freed**: ~11 GB

### Developer Experience
- **Before**: Confusion about which roadmap/doc is current
- **After**: DOCUMENTATION_MATRIX.md provides instant lookup, DOCUMENTATION.md provides rules

### AI Assistant Effectiveness
- **Before**: Could get confused by competing sources of truth
- **After**: CLAUDE.md explicitly defines documentation protocol and key references

## ✅ Verification Checklist

Confirm the following still work after cleanup:

### Builds
```bash
cd citrate
cargo build --release              # ✅ Should rebuild (will take time)
forge build                        # ✅ Should rebuild contracts
npm ci && npm run build            # ✅ Should build in GUI/explorer/docs
```

### Tests
```bash
cargo test --workspace             # ✅ Should pass
forge test                         # ✅ Should pass
```

### Scripts
```bash
./scripts/lattice.sh --help        # ✅ Should show help
./scripts/start_testnet.sh --help  # ✅ Should work
```

### Documentation Links
- ✅ Check README.md links work
- ✅ Check CLAUDE.md references are valid
- ✅ Check docs-portal builds successfully

---

## 🚨 Important Notes

### What Was NOT Changed
- ✅ **No code files modified** - All changes were documentation/cleanup only
- ✅ **Git history preserved** - All files moved to archive, not deleted
- ✅ **No configuration changes** - All .toml, .json, Cargo.toml unchanged
- ✅ **Scripts preserved** - All operational scripts in `scripts/` remain

### What Requires Manual Review
1. **SDK Consolidation** - Requires testing before deleting `sdk/` directory
2. **Roadmap Finalization** - Determine if originals can be fully deleted
3. **Config File Duplication** - Check if `citrate/scripts/testnet-config.toml` duplicates `citrate/testnet-config.toml`

### Git Status
The cleanup created these changes:
- New files: DOCUMENTATION.md, DOCUMENTATION_MATRIX.md, CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md
- Modified: README.md, CLAUDE.md
- Moved: 20+ files to archive/
- Deleted: target/, contracts/out/ (build artifacts, gitignored)

**Recommendation**: Review changes with `git status` and `git diff` before committing.

## 📖 For Future Contributors

**Read these first**:
1. [DOCUMENTATION_MATRIX.md](./DOCUMENTATION_MATRIX.md) - Find any document instantly
2. [DOCUMENTATION.md](./DOCUMENTATION.md) - Understand the governance rules
3. [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) - AI assistant context & architecture
4. [citrate/README.md](./citrate/README.md) - Complete technical guide

**Key principle**: **One source of truth per topic**. Link, don't duplicate.

**This cleanup establishes a clean foundation for Phase 4 development and future distribution readiness.**
