## Decisions Made

### Decision 1: Search Library Selection
**Date:** _TBD_
**Decision:** _TBD: FlexSearch vs MiniSearch vs Custom_
**Rationale:** _To be determined during implementation_
**Impact:** _Affects client-side search performance_

**Options Considered:**
- **FlexSearch:** Fast, good for large datasets, complex API
- **MiniSearch:** Simpler API, good TypeScript support, smaller
- **Custom:** Full control, but more maintenance

**Recommendation:** Start with FlexSearch for performance, fall back to MiniSearch if complexity is an issue.

---

### Decision 2: Metrics Storage Strategy
**Date:** _TBD_
**Decision:** _TBD: On-chain vs Off-chain vs Hybrid_
**Rationale:** _To be determined during implementation_
**Impact:** _Affects cost, performance, and reliability_

**Options Considered:**
- **On-chain:** Transparent, immutable, but expensive
- **Off-chain:** Cheap, fast, but requires trust
- **Hybrid:** Critical metrics on-chain, detailed off-chain

**Recommendation:** Use hybrid approach - aggregate metrics on-chain (daily rollups), detailed metrics off-chain with periodic merkle commitments.

---

### Decision 3: Quality Score Algorithm
**Date:** _TBD_
**Decision:** _Component weights: Rating (40%), Performance (30%), Reliability (20%), Engagement (10%)_
**Rationale:** _Prioritize user satisfaction (rating) and technical quality (performance/reliability)_
**Impact:** _Determines how models are ranked and discovered_

**Notes:** May need to adjust weights based on feedback. Consider adding decay factor for old reviews.

---

### Decision 4: IPFS Gateway Selection
**Date:** _TBD_
**Decision:** _TBD: Public gateway vs Pinata vs Infura vs Self-hosted_
**Rationale:** _To be determined based on reliability and cost_
**Impact:** _Affects metadata fetch reliability_

**Options Considered:**
- **ipfs.io:** Free, but slow and unreliable
- **Pinata:** Reliable, CDN, paid
- **Infura:** Reliable, but rate limited
- **Self-hosted:** Full control, requires infrastructure

**Recommendation:** Use Pinata for production, ipfs.io as fallback for development.

---

### Decision 5: Review Voting Storage
**Date:** _TBD_
**Decision:** _TBD: On-chain vs Off-chain_
**Rationale:** _Voting is high-volume, on-chain would be expensive_
**Impact:** _Cost vs transparency tradeoff_

**Recommendation:** Store votes off-chain with periodic merkle root commitment on-chain for verification.

## Technical Challenges

### Challenge 1: Search Performance with Large Datasets
**Description:** Need to maintain <500ms search response time with 10K+ models
**Impact:** User experience degraded if search is slow
**Attempted Solutions:**
- _TBD: Web Workers for indexing_
- _TBD: Index caching in localStorage/IndexedDB_
- _TBD: Pagination and lazy loading_

**Status:** _TBD_
**Resolution:** _TBD_

---

### Challenge 2: IPFS Metadata Reliability
**Description:** IPFS can be slow or unreliable, causing metadata fetch timeouts
**Impact:** Model cards fail to load, poor user experience
**Attempted Solutions:**
- _TBD: 10s timeout with fallback_
- _TBD: Aggressive caching_
- _TBD: Use premium IPFS gateway_

**Status:** _TBD_
**Resolution:** _TBD_

---

### Challenge 3: Metrics Collection Overhead
**Description:** Tracking every inference could add latency
**Impact:** Inference performance degraded
**Attempted Solutions:**
- _TBD: Async metrics collection_
- _TBD: Batching metrics writes_
- _TBD: Sampling for high-volume models_

**Status:** _TBD_
**Resolution:** _TBD_

---

### Challenge 4: Quality Score Gaming
**Description:** Model owners might try to manipulate quality scores
**Impact:** Unfair rankings, reduced trust
**Attempted Solutions:**
- _TBD: Verified purchase requirement for reviews_
- _TBD: Review age decay_
- _TBD: Outlier detection_

**Status:** _TBD_
**Resolution:** _TBD_
