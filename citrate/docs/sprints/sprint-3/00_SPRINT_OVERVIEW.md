## Risk Register

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Contract compilation fails in browser | Medium | High | Use pre-compiled bytecode option, server-side compilation fallback |
| WebSocket connection drops frequently | Medium | Medium | Auto-reconnect logic, fallback to polling |
| ABI parsing errors with complex types | Medium | Medium | Comprehensive test suite, manual ABI input option |
| DAG rendering performance degrades | Low | High | Virtual scrolling, canvas-based rendering, Web Workers |
| Model loading times too slow | Medium | Low | Progress indicators, background loading, caching |
