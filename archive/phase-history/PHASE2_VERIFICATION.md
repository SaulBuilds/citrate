## Missing/Incomplete Components

### 1. Actual Inference Execution
**Location**: `core/network/src/ai_handler.rs:279`
```rust
// TODO: Actually run inference if we have compute capacity
```
**Impact**: Models can be deployed but not executed on-chain
**Solution**: Needs CoreML library binding in Rust

### 2. Inference Precompiles
**Status**: Not implemented
**Required**: EVM precompile addresses for AI operations
**Files Needed**:
- `core/execution/src/precompiles/inference.rs`
- Gas calculation for AI operations
- Proof verification in EVM

### 3. MLX Framework Integration
**Status**: Framework structure exists, no implementation
**Blocker**: MLX is still in early release
**Alternative**: Focus on CoreML for now

### 4. Training Job Management
**Location**: `core/api/src/methods/ai.rs`
```rust
// TODO: Implement database iteration and filtering for training jobs
```
**Impact**: Can't track distributed training
**Priority**: Low (Phase 4 feature)
