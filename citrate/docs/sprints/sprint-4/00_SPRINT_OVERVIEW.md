## Context & Dependencies

### Sprint 3 Deliverables (Complete)
- ✅ ModelRegistry contract deployed
- ✅ ModelMarketplace contract with reviews/ratings
- ✅ InferenceRouter for model execution
- ✅ LoRAFactory for fine-tuned model variants
- ✅ Full revm v10 integration
- ✅ Basic listing and purchase functionality

### Known Limitations from Sprint 3
- ⚠️ State persistence needs addressing (revm integration complete but persistence layer pending)
- ⚠️ No search/discovery beyond category browsing
- ⚠️ Limited metadata beyond basic model info
- ⚠️ Rating system exists but needs quality metrics

### Sprint 4 Focus
This sprint builds the **discovery layer** on top of Sprint 3's marketplace infrastructure. We're implementing:
1. **Search Engine** - Fast full-text search with filtering
2. **Quality Metrics** - Performance scoring, reliability tracking
3. **Enhanced Metadata** - Rich model cards, usage statistics
4. **Recommendations** - User-based and collaborative filtering

## Risk Register

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Search performance degrades with large datasets | Medium | High | Implement pagination, caching, and indexing; use vector search for similarity |
| IPFS metadata fetching too slow | Medium | Medium | Cache metadata locally, use IPFS gateway CDN, background sync |
| Rating manipulation/spam reviews | High | High | Require verified purchases, rate limiting, reputation scoring |
| Metrics collection overhead impacts inference | Low | High | Async metrics reporting, batching, sampling |
| Complex recommendation algorithm too slow | Medium | Medium | Pre-compute recommendations, use simple collaborative filtering initially |

---

## Dependencies

### External Libraries Needed
- `flexsearch` or `minisearch` (client-side search indexing)
- `recharts` or `visx` (metrics visualization - already installed)
- `react-query` (data fetching and caching)
- `lodash` (data manipulation utilities)
- `date-fns` (date formatting)

### Backend/Node Dependencies
- `ipfs-http-client` (IPFS integration)
- `node-cache` (in-memory caching)
- Background job system (optional: `bull` or simple setInterval)

### Smart Contract Additions (Optional)
- Consider adding `ModelMetrics` contract for on-chain performance tracking
- Or use off-chain storage with periodic merkle root commitments

### Blocked By
- Sprint 3 completion (marketplace infrastructure)
- State persistence solution (can work around with testnet resets)

### Blocking
- Sprint 5 (Advanced marketplace features) requires discovery system
- GUI integration depends on API endpoints from this sprint
