## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Problem Statement

Current blockchain architectures face three critical limitations:

1. **Linear Bottlenecks**: Traditional single-chain designs force sequential processing, limiting throughput to 15-100 TPS
2. **Bridge Vulnerabilities**: $2.5B+ lost to bridge hacks in 2022-2023, primarily due to trusted intermediary models
3. **AI Opacity**: No verifiable substrate for AI model training, evaluation, and deployment across chains

### 1.2 Solution Overview

Lattice Network addresses these challenges through:

- **BlockDAG Consensus**: Parallel block creation and processing enabling 10,000+ TPS
- **Native Cross-Chain Verification**: Light client modules for major chains with ZK proof verification
- **AI Knowledge Graph**: Multi-parent DAG structure encoding model lineage and evaluation semantics
- **Modular Architecture**: Pluggable modules for new chains and execution environments

## 2. Core Architecture

### 2.1 BlockDAG Structure

Unlike traditional blockchains that form a single chain, Lattice uses a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) where:

- Blocks reference multiple parents (k=2-4 typical)
- Parallel block creation without fork waste
- GHAST consensus algorithm for total ordering
- Security scales as f^k for adversary fraction f

**Block Header Structure:**
```
{
  block_hash: Hash256,
  parent_hashes: [Hash256; k],
  edge_types: [EdgeType; k],  // extends, cites, evaluates, refutes
  artifact_commitment: Multihash,
  state_root: Hash256,
  timestamp: u64,
  proposer: PublicKey,
  signature: Signature
}
```

### 2.2 Consensus Mechanism

**Hybrid PoS/DAG Consensus:**
- Validators stake native tokens to participate
- GHAST (Greedy Heaviest Adaptive Subtree) for chain selection
- 2-second block times with instant inclusion
- Finality achieved in 6-12 seconds

**Security Properties:**
- Requires >51% stake to reorder finalized blocks
- Multi-parent references prevent long-range attacks
- Slashing for equivocation and invalid blocks

### 2.3 Execution Layer (LVM)

**Initial: EVM Fork**
- Full Solidity compatibility
- Existing Ethereum tooling support
- Custom precompiles for DAG operations

**Planned: WASM Support**
- Rust/C++ smart contracts
- More efficient execution
- Cross-VM calls between EVM and WASM

**Custom Precompiles:**
- `0x100`: DAG reachability queries
- `0x101`: ZK proof verification (Groth16, Plonk)
- `0x102`: Cross-chain header validation
- `0x103`: BLS signature aggregation
- `0x104`: Blake3 hashing

## 3. Cross-Chain Interoperability

### 3.1 Module-Based Architecture

Each supported blockchain has a dedicated module containing:

- **Light Client**: Tracks headers and state roots
- **Proof Verifier**: Validates Merkle proofs and signatures
- **State Sync**: Updates tracked state via relayers
- **Query Interface**: Handles cross-chain data requests

**Supported Chains (Phase 1):**
- Ethereum (via beacon chain light client)
- Cosmos chains (via IBC)
- Bitcoin (via simplified payment verification)
- Polygon, BSC, Avalanche (via checkpoint systems)

### 3.2 Verifiable Query Protocol

**Query Flow:**
1. User submits query transaction with proof requirements
2. Relevant module validates proof against stored headers
3. Result committed to DAG with cryptographic attestation
4. Target chain module can trigger action based on verified result

**Example: Token Bridge**
```solidity
function bridgeTokens(
    uint256 sourceChain,
    bytes32 lockTxHash,
    bytes merkleProof
) external {
    require(modules[sourceChain].verifyInclusion(lockTxHash, merkleProof));
    _mintBridgedTokens(msg.sender, amount);
}
```

### 3.3 Zero-Knowledge Bridge Security

**Trust-Minimized Design:**
- No multisig committees or trusted validators
- Every cross-chain claim requires cryptographic proof
- ZK-SNARKs for succinct verification
- Recursive proofs for chain-of-chains verification
