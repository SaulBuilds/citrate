## Decisions Made

### Decision 1: Virtualization Library Selection
**Date:** _TBD_
**Decision:** _TBD: react-window vs react-virtualized vs custom_
**Rationale:** _To be determined during implementation_
**Impact:** _Affects virtual scrolling performance and bundle size_

**Options Considered:**
- **react-window:** Lightweight, modern, good performance
- **react-virtualized:** Feature-rich, heavier bundle, mature
- **Custom:** Full control, more maintenance, potential bugs

**Recommendation:** Use react-window for smaller bundle size and modern API. Mature library with good TypeScript support.

---

### Decision 2: PDF Export Library
**Date:** _TBD_
**Decision:** _TBD: jspdf vs pdfmake vs canvas-based_
**Rationale:** _To be determined based on formatting needs_
**Impact:** _Affects export quality and bundle size_

**Options Considered:**
- **jspdf:** Popular, good docs, requires autotable plugin
- **pdfmake:** Declarative API, better layouts, larger bundle
- **Canvas-based:** Full control, complex implementation

**Recommendation:** Use jspdf with jspdf-autotable for balance of features and bundle size.

---

### Decision 3: Touch Gesture Library
**Date:** _TBD_
**Decision:** _TBD: @use-gesture/react vs react-swipeable vs custom_
**Rationale:** _Need comprehensive gesture support_
**Impact:** _User experience on mobile_

**Options Considered:**
- **@use-gesture/react:** Comprehensive, modern, React-friendly
- **react-swipeable:** Simple, lightweight, swipe-only
- **Custom:** Full control, more testing needed

**Recommendation:** Use @use-gesture/react for comprehensive gesture support and good developer experience.

---

### Decision 4: Service Worker Strategy
**Date:** _TBD_
**Decision:** _Network strategies for different resource types_
**Rationale:** _Balance freshness and performance_
**Impact:** _Offline capability and load times_

**Strategies:**
- **API calls:** Network-first (freshness)
- **Images:** Cache-first (performance)
- **Static assets:** Stale-while-revalidate (balance)
- **Critical assets:** Precache

**Recommendation:** Use Workbox for easy configuration and proven strategies.

---

### Decision 5: Analytics Aggregation Strategy
**Date:** _TBD_
**Decision:** _TBD: Real-time vs Pre-computed vs Hybrid_
**Rationale:** _Balance accuracy and performance_
**Impact:** _Dashboard load time and data freshness_

**Options Considered:**
- **Real-time:** Fresh data, slow queries
- **Pre-computed:** Fast, stale data (computed hourly/daily)
- **Hybrid:** Critical metrics real-time, detailed metrics pre-computed

**Recommendation:** Use hybrid approach - real-time for totals, pre-computed for historical trends.
